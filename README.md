I read some papers for recommendation based on knowledge graph, and reproduced/rewrote the paper code using Tensorflow 2.1.0.

It is hoped that these models can be used to recommend healthy foods with target gains and preferences for users. The goal gain here refers to the user's personal goal, such as losing weight, helping bowel movements, improving sleep, etc. This scenario will use a lot of professional knowledge of nutrition, so the knowledge map of the vertical field of nutrition is introduced as the recommended side info.


This is a test project for Recommendation evaluation for HYPEBITE
